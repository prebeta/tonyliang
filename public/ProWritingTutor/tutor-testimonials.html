	 <p class="quote">Dan worked with my son in developing his college applications essays.

     His work was exceptional.  My son actively incorporated his analysis

     and suggestions and went back for more!  His essays helped land 7

     college acceptances and he accepted a merit scholarship from Case

     Western University.</p>

	 <p class="quote">Last year Daniel Lichterman taught my daughter’s high school English class. The course

	 brought to life a thought-provoking dialogue exploring literary themes.  Daniel brings to his classroom 

	 instruction a river of thinking with a breadth and depth that inspired my daughter to realize, through 

	 her writing, brilliant expressions of her inner and outer world.</p>

	 <p class="quote">Daniel tutored our son during his middle school and high school years. Daniel brings 

	 wonderful skills to the job, not only a great gift for writing, but also an exuberant and engaging way 

	 of relating to kids as they struggle through various assignments. Daniel had an immeasurable impact on 

	 our family, not only taking homework off our plates, but also giving our son the confidence and skills 

	 to work more successfully on his own. We are very grateful!</p>

	 <p class="quotesig"> Joanne (San Francisco CA)</p>	 

	 

	 <p class="quote">In 2006, for eight months, Daniel Lichterman was a writing tutor for our daughter Emily,

	 a 7th grader and our son Alex, a 9th grader. Daniel, who is a very talented writer, is also an equally gifted,

	 caring and sensitive teacher who takes his tutoring responsibilities seriously. Our children present opposite 

	 ends of the writing spectrum – Emily is a skilled and thoughtful writer and Alex, although very bright in mathematics, 

	 is resistant to all written work and has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, a condition that often exacerbates

	 his distractibility and organizational difficulties.  <br/><br/>

     Daniel helped to motivate Emily to explore new topics and genres. With Daniel, she wrote some of her most compelling 

	 stories and poems and even more importantly, she began to take herself seriously as a writer and to think positively 

	 about her own talents.  <br/><br/>

     In the area of writing, our son Alex has been a challenge for teachers and tutors over his years at school. His writing 

	 level is far more elementary than one would expect for someone of his age and intellectual ability and he was quite vocal

	 about not wanting to do any of his writing assignments. Alex reached a place where he did not want to even attempt his

	 writing assignments. Daniel's work with Alex has significantly improved this difficult situation. He encouraged Alex to 

	 complete his work in a timely manner, to become more organizationally independent, and to expand his writing by infusing

	 his sentences with explanatory details. <br/><br/>



	Both our children liked Daniel very much as a person and as a tutor. They looked forward to his arrival and respected his

	abilities. Again, I want to emphasize that Daniel's ability to develop a special connection to our son is no small accomplishment 

	since Alex is also shy and has difficulty forming relationships. Daniel brings unique gifts to his teaching and his enthusiasm 

	and belief in each child's abilities was definitely contagious. </p>

	<p class="quote">After spending months attempting to write my college essay a friend recommended that I go to Dan.  

		 I am so glad that I did. Dan challenged me to write about myself in a way that I had never been asked to do before. 

		 With Dan it was not about who I was as a student but rather who I am as a person. When I sent off my college applications, 

		 I didn’t have to worry about my essay, because I knew it was my best work. Six weeks later I got a letter from Harvard inviting

		 me to an exclusive on-campus interview with a note: they loved my essay. </p>

	 <p class="quote">I applied to the increasingly competitive national program called Teach For America. Only the top 10% of 

	 applicants were admitted this year, and I had little to distinguish my application from others besides my passion for the cause.

	 I couldn't have expressed that passion without Dan's help. He guided me through the writing process so that I could produce an

	 attention-grabbing personal statement that got me in the door! Thanks Dan!</p>

	 <p class="quote">I was very nervous about writing the personal statement for my Grad School application. Dan helped me define 

	 an outstanding plan for the paper and patiently guided me through the writing process. Now I am heading into a writing intensive

	 grad school program with new skills and confidence!</p>

	 <p class="quote">My experience with Daniel Lichterman as a writing tutor came during my application for the prestigious Nation

	 Science Foundation Pre-doctoral Scholarship in late 2005. On very short notice, Daniel agreeably read, proofed, and provided

	 point-by-point suggestions on portions of my application. I found that his comments on the personal essay portion of my application

	 were particularly insightful and his suggestions helped me to crystallize my ideas and strengthen the persuasiveness of my arguments.

	 I was also impressed by his ability to provide useful suggestions on essays that were largely scientific and technical in nature. 

	 Having known Daniel for several years, I can also testify for his ability to reach people of all ages and at very different stages 

	 in their professional development. I think that Daniel's creativity and his enthusiasm for communication would make him a great tutor

	 especially for college applicants.</p>

	<p class="quote">I recently took an online college English class and realized after the 1st week that I needed a tutor. I had an

	assignment due and my first paper was returned that day with a D; I was really in need of immediate help.  I explained my situation

	to Dan and he said “no problem, send over what you have written and the assignment, and I’ll get back with you in a few hours”.  I was

	thrilled but skeptical because he’s located in California and I’m in Florida, but I didn’t have much choice.   <br/><br/>

    Dan called me a few hours later as promised and we spent an hour discussing and brainstorming my assignment.  By the end of this conversation,

	I had a completely different understanding of what the writer was trying to convey and submitted another write-up of my analysis to Dan via e-mail; 

	again, he was there to respond immediately.  The next morning I sat down at my computer and typed up another draft paying close attention to Dan’s

	comments and feedback.  I hit the send button and shortly thereafter he replied with additional comments, but this time he noted in several sections

	of the new draft the word “excellent” ; I was thrilled!  <br/><br/>

    From this point I knew that Dan was the right choice and he worked with me throughout the entire semester.  Needless to say, this class was 

	very difficult , but the long distance communication with Dan via the internet and phone was just the opposite. I would have never thought 

	that I could hire a tutor in another state, yet another time zone and have things work out so perfectly.   My grades improved significantly,

	and I learned a great deal more from this course than I would have without working with Dan.  I have more papers to write over the next few 

	years while I work on my degree, and will definitely keep Dan’s information handy.  <br/><br/></p>

	 <p class="quotesig">Kathleen M.  (Tampa, Florida)</p>	 

	 

	 <p class="quote">I have two major difficulties with writing.  One is organizing my rough drafts, after extensive brainstorming, into logical, 

	 cogent writing.  For years my difficulty with building “strong analysis” out of the rich details of my research has hindered my self-confidence

	 as a student.<br/><br/>

	 Throughout the past eighteen months, Dan has been helping me organize my thoughts and ideas into themes, and spot connections between themes.

	 Dan’s skill in managing detail is remarkable, and he never fails to help me navigate the intricate, complex relationships amongst thoughts and 

	 ideas expressed with seemingly unrelated words and phrases.  Dan is a master at interpreting details and helping the student translate them into

	 powerful themes.<br/><br/>

     My second major difficulty is “mental blanks” – what some call “writer’s block” – that so often paralyzes many student-writers.  For a long time,

	 I struggled alone to fill in these “mental blanks.”  Dan helped me get past the emotional resistance that kept me from communicating my thoughts.<br/><br/>



      Dan’s asks tough questions, makes poignant observations, and is not afraid to challenge assumptions.  Dan’s ability to elicit thought-provoking 

	  information has not only helped me write better, but also inspired me to want to write more.  Working with Dan has been a journey of rigorous

	  self-reflection.  With every paper I write comes an honest appraisal of my attitudes and judgments.  I have come to know the healing effect of 

	  creative, thoughtful, self-expression in the written form.  What more can anyone ask of a tutor!  <br/><br/></p>

	 <p class="quote">As a musician, I am constantly writing bios, grant proposals,

publicity and promotional materials, and letters to venues, reviewers,

and record labels.  Daniel's guidance has been a tremendous help for

me in producing documents that are professional, effective, and stand

out among countless others.</p>

	 <p class="quote">Most recently, Daniel helped me compose a cover letter and statement

of teaching philosophy to use in an application for a college teaching

position.  Through these materials, I wanted to offer a memorable

first impression to the hiring committee.  Daniel helped me get my

thoughts across in a way that was clear and effective.  The final

draft made me confident that I would seem a strong candidate for the

position.</p>

	 <p class="quote">As a writing tutor and editor, Daniel is enthusiastic and extremely

thorough.  Both an accomplished writer and a generous teacher, he is

eager to share his talent for writing with his students.  Daniel has

my highest recommendation.</p>

	 <p class="quote">Daniel brings an enthusiasm and creativity to teaching that is contagious. In the classroom, Daniel is a dynamic instructor 

	 whose passion for language and ideas is immediately evident. He draws students into the world of literature through lessons that directly engage

	 adolescent interests. He uses his humor and his playfulness with language to challenge students to articulate their ideas with clarity and 

	 conviction. Daniel has high expectations of his students, and he gives his students extensive feedback on their drafts to guide their writing

	 development. He also has the sensitivity and psychological insight necessary for building trust with students across the developmental spectrum.</p>

	 <p class="quotesig">Bob C. (Guidance Council Chair, Mount Madonna School) </p>



	 <p class="quote">Daniel’s engagement with students, and his kindness and sincerity, promoted positive relationships between him and his students.

	 Daniel has a brilliant, analytical mind and leads students in dialogue to decipher the meaning and understand motivation in literary passages. 

	 He is an excellent writer himself and creates opportunities through student writings and teacher feedback for students to grow into self-confident

	 writers. </p>

	 <p class="quotesig">Jivanti R. (Mount Madonna School Interim Head of School) </p>		 

	 

	 <p class="quote">His students enjoy his classes and respect his intelligence and ability to draw forth their critical thinking 

	 skills and writing abilities.</p>

	 <p class="quotesig">Sarojani R. (Mount Madonna School Administration)</p>		



	 <p class="quote">Daniel Lichterman has learned his craft the ideal way: by mastering each step of the writing process under the exacting 

	 tutelage of experienced, published authors. He knows by experience the pitfalls, the psychological stumbling blocks, and the compositional

	 dead ends that assail the novice writer. He has acquired the full range of tools for dealing with the full gamut of writing problems. At

	 once reassuring and demanding, empathetic and unswervingly focused on the end point, Daniel delivers something much more productive for 

	 the student than a well-crafted essay: he gives the aspiring writer the skill set to produce a thoughtful, well-argued and precisely 

	 articulated piece of writing that is the product of inspiration, perspiration, and revision.</p>
