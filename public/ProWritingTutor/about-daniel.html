	  <h1> &nbsp;About Pro Writing Tutor</h1>

	 <p><img src="images/Headshot200.jpg" align="left">

	 Daniel Lichterman has worked as a writing coach, admission essay specialist and professional editor for over 15 years. He has taught grades 9-12 Honors and AP English at Mount Madonna High School and is a preferred educational therapist at the Bay School in San Francisco. Daniel Lichterman loves to engage his students in a writing dialogue that builds upon their unique strengths and interests. He believes that every student can develop the critical reasoning skills and persuasive techniques necessary for successful writing. He is a Reed College graduate with a B.A. in English Literature. </p>

	 <p class="quote">"Daniel Lichterman has learned his craft the ideal way: by mastering each step of the

	 writing process under the exacting tutelage of experienced, published authors. He knows by experience 

	 the pitfalls, the psychological stumbling blocks, and the compositional dead ends that assail the novice

	 writer. He has acquired the full range of tools for dealing with the full gamut of writing problems. At 

	 once reassuring and demanding, empathetic and unswervingly focused on the end point, Daniel delivers 

	 something much more productive for the student than a well-crafted essay: he gives the aspiring writer 

	 the skill set to produce a thoughtful, well-argued and precisely articulated piece of writing that is the

	 product of inspiration, perspiration, and revision."
